# Olamina Faction Website

## Tech Stack
1. React - our frontend uses React
2. Airtable - our "backend" (really there is no backend we are simply using the airtable api to read data from an airtable spreadsheet)
3. Netlify - our server (synced with github main branch)

## Credentials you need to gather 
1. You need the airtable API key (env variable name is REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_API_KEY).
2. You need edit access to the airtable to update the website content.
3. You need netlify credentials to access the server settings.
4. You need access to this github to make changes to the website code. 

## Basic commands to get up and running 

### `npm build`

Builds the app.\
You need to run this the first time you run the code and anytime an npm package is added.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
